# Welcome to statTarget ! 

`Quality Control (QC)` has been considered as an essential step in the
MS-based omics platform for high reproducibility and accuracy of data. 
The repetitive use of the same QC samples is more and more accepted for 
evaluation and correction of the signal drift during the sequence of MS run order, 
especially beneficial to improve the quality of data in multi-blocks 
experiments (Dunn, W.B., et al., 2011). statTarget is a streamlined tool 
to provide a graphical user interface for `quality control based
 signal correction`, and integration of MS data from `multi-batch of 
experiments`, and comprehensive statistic analysis for 
 MS-based Omics data.
This document is intended to guide the user to use the functions to 
perform data analysis, such as shiftCor, statAnalysis, statTargetGUI functions, etc.

## What does statTarget offer statistically

The statTarget has two basic sections. The first section 
is Signal Correction (See the shiftCor function). It includes 'Ensemble Learning' for QC based signal correction. For example, QC-based random forest correction (QC-RFSC) and QC-based LOESS signal correction (QCRLSC). (Dunn WB., et al. 2011; Luan H., et al. 2015). In addition, Combat is also provided for QC free datasets. The second 
section is Statistical Analysis (See the statAnalysis function). It provides comprehensively computational and statistical methods that are commonly applied to analyze Omics data,
and offers multiple results for biomarker discovery. The statTargetGUI provides the simple easy to use interface for the above functions.

`Section 1 - Signal Correction` provide `ensemble learning method` for QC based signal correction. i.e. QC based random forest signal correction (QC-RFSC) that fit the QC data, 
and each metabolites in the true sample will be normalized to the QC sample. 

`Section 2 - Statistical Analysis` provide features including Data preprocessing, Data descriptions, Multivariate statistics analysis and Univariate analysis.


Data preprocessing : 80-precent rule, sum normalization (SUM) and probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN), glog transformation, KNN imputation, median imputation, and minimum imputation.


Data descriptions :  Mean value, Median value, sum, Quartile, Standard 
derivatives, etc.


Multivariate statistics analysis : PCA, PLSDA, VIP, Random forest, Permutation-based feature selection.


Univariate analysis : Welch's T-test, Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Mann-Whitney test.


Biomarkers analysis: ROC, Odd ratio, Adjusted P-value, Box plot and Volcano plot.


### statTargetGUI 

```
## Examples Code for graphical user interface 

library(statTarget)

statTargetGUI()

#For mac PC,  the GUI function 'statTargetGUI()' need the XQuartz instead of X11 support. Download it from https://www.xquartz.org. R 3.3.0 and RGtk2 2.20.31 are recommended for RGtk2 installation.

```

`statTargetGUI`



Download the [Reference manual](https://github.com/13479776/Picture/blob/master/statTarget-manual.pdf) and [example data](https://github.com/13479776/Picture/raw/master/Data_example.zip) .




### Running Signal Correction (the shiftCor function) from the GUI


`Meta File`
  
  
  Meta information includes the Sample name, class, batch and order. 
  Do not change the name of each column
  
  (1) Class: The QC should be labeled as NA
 
  (2) Order : Injection sequence. 
  
  (3) Batch: The analysis blocks or batches
  
  (4) Sample: Sample name should be consistent in Meta file and Profile file. *The QC sample name should be tagged with "QC".
  
  (See the example data)


`Profile File`


Expression data includes the sample name and expression
data.(See the example data)


`NA.Filter`


Modified n precent rule function. A variable will be kept if it has a non-zero value for at least n precent of samples in any one group. (Default: 0.8)  
 

`MLmethod`
 

 The QC-based signal correction (i.e. QC-RFSC, QC-RLSC.) or QC-free methods (Combat) 
 

`Ntree`
	
	
Number of trees to grow for QC-RFSC (Default: 500) .


`QCspan`


The smoothing parameter for QCRLSC which controls the bias-variance tradeoff. 
The common range of QCspan value is from 0.5 to 0.75. If you choose
a span that is too small then there will be a large variance. 
If the span is too large, a large bias will be produced. 
The default value of QCspan is set at '0', the generalised 
cross-validation will be performed for choosing a good value, 
avoiding overfitting of the observed data. (Default: 0) 



`Imputation`


 The parameter for imputation method.(i.e., 
 nearest neighbor averaging, "KNN"; minimum values, "min"; Half of minimum values 
"minHalf" median values, "median". (Default: KNN) 



```
## Examples Code

library(statTarget)

datpath <- system.file('extdata',package = 'statTarget')
samPeno <- paste(datpath,'MTBLS79_sampleList.csv', sep='/')
samFile <- paste(datpath,'MTBLS79.csv', sep='/')
shiftCor(samPeno,samFile, Frule = 0.8, MLmethod = "QCRFSC", QCspan = 0,imputeM = "KNN")
# Combat for QC-free datasets
samPeno2 <- paste(datpath,'MTBLS79_dQC_sampleList.csv', sep='/')
shiftCor_dQC(samPeno2,samFile, Frule = 0.8, MLmethod = "Combat")

See ?shiftCor for off-line help
```

```
## Examples Code

library(statTarget)

datpath <- system.file('extdata',package = 'statTarget')
dataXcms <- paste(datpath,'xcmsOutput.tsv', sep='/')
dataSkyline <- paste(datpath,'skylineDemo.csv', sep='/')
transX(dataXcms,'xcms')

# Random Forest classfication 
rFtest <- rForest(getFile,ntree = 10,times = 5)

# Prediction of test data using random forest in statTarget.
predictOutput <- predict_RF(rFtest, getFile[1:19,3:8])

# Multi-dimensional scaling plot of proximity matrix from randomForest.
mdsPlot(rFtest$randomForest,rFtest$pimpTest)

# Create plots for Gini importance and permutation-based variable Gini importance measures.
pvimPlot(rFtest$randomForest,rFtest$pimpTest)
