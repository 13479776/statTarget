==============
**News 2016-12-17: [Development version 1.5.5] (http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/statTarget.html "version 1.5.2")  have been released.** (statTarget Alert added)

2016-11-12: [Development version 1.5.1] (http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/statTarget.html "version 1.5.1")  have been released. (Bugs fix)


Description
-----------------

An `easy to use tool` provides `graphical user interface` for quality control based `shift signal correction`, `integration of metabolomic data` from multi-batch experiments, and the `comprehensive statistic analysis` in non-targeted or targeted metabolomics.

The Manual: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/statTarget/inst/doc/statTarget.html

The main `GUI of statTarget` has two basic components. The first is shift correction. It includes `quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction (QC-RLSC)` that is a widely accepted method for quality control based signal correction and integration of metabolomic data from multiple analytical batches (Dunn WB., et al. 2011; Luan H., et al. 2015).

`statTarget - Shift Correction` provide QC-RLSC algorithm that fit the QC data, and each metabolites in the true sample will be normalized to the QC sample. Additionally, LOESS based generalised cross-validation (GCV) would be automatically applied to avoid overfitting of the observed data, when the QCspan was set at 0 (Default value).

`statTarget - Statistical Analysis` provide features including Data preprocessing, Data descriptions, Multivariate statistics analysis and Univariate analysis.


Data preprocessing : 80-precent rule, glog transformation, KNN imputation, Median imputation and Minimum values imputation.


Data descriptions : Mean value, Median value, Sum, Quartile, Standard derivatives, etc.


Multivariate statistics analysis : PCA, PLSDA, VIP, Random forest.


Univariate analysis : Student T-test, Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Mann-Whitney tests. 


Biomarkers analysis : ROC, Odd ratio, P-value, and Volcano plot.

Usage
-----------------

1 If you did not install the R software yet,you can download R >= 3.3.0  from https://www.r-project.org

2 Install the package "statTarget" at the Bioconductor
 
  For Windows PC, copy this code into R 
  
  > source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") 
  
  > biocLite("statTarget")
  
  > library(statTarget)  ## `Load statTarget`
  
  > statTargetGUI()  ## `Execute statTarget GUI` 
  
  
  For mac PC,  X11 support being installed. XQuartz could be installed. Download it from https://www.xquartz.org
  
  Copy this code into R
  
  > source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  
  > biocLite("statTarget")
  
  > library(statTarget)  ## `Load statTarget`
  
  > statTargetGUI()  ## `Execute statTarget GUI` 
  

4 Input data and run.
